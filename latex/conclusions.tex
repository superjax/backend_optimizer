\section{Conclusions}

% Pose graphs and relative navigation setups are a scaleable way to make a multi-agent MAV system
% Edge optimization is helpful in initializing pose graph optimizations
% Edge optimization can help avoid graph divergence
% Using stochastic gradient descent in edge optimization can help reduce burden with a large number of edges
% Future work - Better understanding of how to detect incorrect loop closures with edge optimization
