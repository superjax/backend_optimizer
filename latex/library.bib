abstract = {Over the past few years, the application of camera-equipped Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for visually monitoring construction and operation of buildings, bridges, and other types of civil infrastructure systems has exponentially grown. These platforms can frequently survey construction sites, monitor work-in-progress, create documents for safety, and inspect existing structures, particularly for hard-to-reach areas. The purpose of this paper is to provide a concise review of the most recent methods that streamline collection, analysis, visualization, and communication of the visual data captured from these platforms, with and without using Building Information Models (BIM) as {\textless}Emphasis Type="Italic"{\textgreater}a priori{\textless}/Emphasis{\textgreater} information. Specifically, the most relevant works from Civil Engineering, Computer Vision, and Robotics communities are presented and compared in terms of their potential to lead to automatic construction monitoring and civil infrastructure condition assessment.},

@article{Metni2007,
abstract = {This paper describes the dynamics of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for monitoring of structures and maintenance of bridges. It presents a novel control law based on computer vision for quasi-stationary flights above a planar target. The first part of the UAV's mission is the navigation from an initial position to a final position in an unknown 3D environment. The new control law uses the homography matrix computed from the information obtained from the vision system. The control scheme will be derived with backstepping techniques. In order to keep the camera's field of view, the control law uses saturation functions for bounding the UAV orientation and limiting it to very small values. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Steich2016,
abstract = {— We present an aerial robotic platform for remote tree cavity inspection, based on a hexacopter Micro-Aerial vehicle (MAV) equipped with a dexterous manipulator. The goal is to make the inspection process safer and more efficient and facilitate data collection about tree cavities, which are important for the conservation of biodiversity in forest ecosystems. This work focuses on two key enabling technologies, namely a vision-based cavity detection system and strategies for high level control of the MAV and manipulator. The results of both simulation and real-world experiments are discussed at the end of the paper and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

UAVs have been utilized following ecological, meteor ological, geological, hydrological and human - induced disasters. The flexibility, safety, ease of operation , and relatively low - cost of ownership and operation facilitate UAV implementation in disaster sit uations.

@article{Remondino2011,
abstract = {UAV platforms are nowadays a valuable source of data for inspection, surveillance, mapping and 3D modeling issues. New applications in the short- and close-range domain are introduced, being the UAVs a low-cost alternatives to the classical manned aerial photogrammetry. Rotary or fixed wing UAVs, capable of performing the photogrammetric data acquisition with amateur or SLR digital cameras, can fly in manual, semi-automated and autonomous modes. With a typical photogrammetric pipeline, 3D results like DSM/DTM, contour lines, textured 3D models, vector data, etc. can be produced, in a reasonable automated way. The paper reports the latest developments of UAV image processing methods for photogrammetric applications, mapping and 3D modeling issues. Automation is nowadays necessary and feasible at the image orientation, DSM generation and orthophoto production stages, while accurate feature extraction is still an interactive procedure. New perspectives are also addressed.},
